  <p> 
	A black hole is a region in space where gravity is extremely strong, pulling everything—including light—toward a point called a singularity. Once 	anything crosses a boundary called the event horizon, it can't escape. They form from the collapsed cores of massive stars and come in various sizes, 	including stellar black holes (from massive stars) and supermassive black holes (found in the centers of galaxies). They're intriguing objects in 	astrophysics, influencing their surroundings gravitationally and challenging to observe directly due to their light-trapping nature.
